    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hobbies</h1>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy staying active through sports. You can find me on the field playing touch rugby or soccer over the weekends. I'm also an avid gamer, with a particular fondness for Call of Duty. I guess you can call me an online gamer as with Fifa you will find me heavily competiting in a good way that is.I love love anime.</p>
    <p>When I'm not being active or gaming, I love to explore my creative side through cooking. I'm always on the lookout for new recipes to try out and experiment with different flavors and cuisines. I'm also working on developing a consistent reading habit, as I believe it's essential for personal growth and relaxation.</p>
    <p>To unwind and spend time with friends and family, I enjoy organizing game nights and going on hiking trips. There's something about being in nature and challenging myself physically that rejuvenates me. Similarly, game nights offer a fun way to socialize and take my mind off the stresses of everyday life.</p>
